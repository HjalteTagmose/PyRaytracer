# PyRaytracer
Raytracer made from scratch using Python

The raytracer takes in an XML file to make light sources, shaders and primitive objects.
It raytracers the scene and exports the final image as png.

Has support for spheres, lights, multiple objects/lights, phong shading, lambertian shading, arbitrary camera position and more!

OBS: Boxes don't work currently.
